          <br />
          My name is Jason, and I'm a first-year graduate student pursuing a
          Master of Computer Science at the University of Illinois
          Urbana-Champaign. I completed my undergrad at UIUC in May 2023 and
          graduated with a BS in Bioengineering and Minor in Computer Science.
          Previously, I have worked at McDonald's as a SWE Intern and Argonne
          National Laboratory as a Machine Learning Intern. I'm excited to
          contribute to innovative projects and continue learning in the dynamic
          world of tech, and I hope to work as a fulltime software engineer
          after graduating!

          <br />
          Long story short, I realized the pre-medical track was not for me, and
          I discovered that I enjoyed the programming aspects of all my
          Bioengineering courses. This led me to pursue a Minor and
          aforementioned internship opportunities in the field of Computer
          Science. Currently, my interests lie in desktop application
          development and web development (full-stack and backend), and the
          intersection of those areas with AI/ML. However, as I am in the
          beginning of my "new" career, I am extremely open to learning and
          pursuing new opportunities outside of those previously mentioned.

          I love listening to music, watching TV shows, playing video games, and
          doing things with my family! My favorite genres are combinations of
          Chillstep, EDM, Pop, and Indie. Some of my favorite shows are Game of
          Thrones, The Bear, and Invincible. My current favorite video games are
          League of Legends and Dark and Darker. Lastly, I love doing things
          with my family, whether that be eating out, visiting and traveling to
          places, or just simply spending time together. I'll end this section
          with a couple fun facts: I am triplet! I am also an avid dog-lover
          (although I don't have one...), and I want a Bernese Mountain Dog in
          the future.

          <h2>Software Engineer Intern @ McDonald's</h2>
          <p>
            During my internship at McDonald's, I had the opportunity to
            contribute significantly to various projects and initiatives, which
            involved leveraging technology and implementing solutions to enhance
            operational efficiency and reliability. Some of my key
            accomplishments during this period include: <br />
            I played an instrumental role in the development of a REST API using
            .NET, C#, and AWS DynamoDB. This API was designed to streamline the
            retrieval of data pertaining to restaurant equipment orders. By
            utilizing these technologies, we were able to enhance the data
            retrieval process, ultimately improving the efficiency of order
            management. <br />
            I also took part in the creation of a web application, employing
            .NET and AngularJS, which served as a valuable tool for managing
            employee access to the company's data. This application facilitated
            secure and efficient data management, contributing to the overall
            effectiveness of information handling within the organization.
            <br />
            One of my key contributions involved optimizing the Kiosk system for
            expedited market deployment. By reducing its dependencies on
            nonessential systems and services, we were able to accelerate the
            time to market by approximately 20%. This enhancement significantly
            improved the efficiency of the Kiosk system rollout. <br />
            In addition to these projects, I played a crucial role in resolving
            critical software bugs and enhancing code test coverage by
            approximately 11%. This effort was aimed at ensuring the system's
            reliability, which is vital for maintaining seamless operations.
            <br />
            Through these accomplishments, I gained valuable experience in
            software development, system optimization, and problem-solving, all
            of which are essential in the dynamic and fast-paced environment of
            the restaurant industry. My internship at McDonald's allowed me to
            make meaningful contributions to the company's technological
            advancement and operational excellence.

          <h2>Machine Learning Intern @ Argonne</h2>
          <p>
            During my tenure, I had the opportunity to spearhead and
            successfully execute a project with a primary focus on addressing
            pressing environmental challenges related to plastic and chemical
            pollution. This endeavor involved harnessing the power of Artificial
            Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to provide
            innovative and effective solutions. Some of the notable achievements
            during this project include: <br />
            I played a pivotal role in the development and deployment of a graph
            neural network designed to classify the biodegradability of
            polymers. This AI-based model exhibited an impressive accuracy rate
            of approximately 92%, offering a highly efficient and cost-effective
            alternative to traditional physical experimentation methods. By
            doing so, we not only streamlined the research process but also
            contributed to sustainable and eco-friendly solutions in the context
            of polymer materials. <br />
            In support of this initiative, I constructed a comprehensive and
            meticulously organized database of polymer characteristics. This
            database not only facilitated the efficient extraction of critical
            data but also laid a robust foundation for future machine learning
            endeavors. It served as a valuable resource for ongoing research and
            development efforts in this domain. <br />
            Another significant aspect of my role involved optimizing and
            refactoring existing machine learning models. Through these efforts,
            I managed to enhance the performance, accuracy, and overall
            usability of these models. This optimization not only improved the
            quality of results but also ensured that the models were more
            accessible and user-friendly. <br />
            By driving this project, I gained valuable experience in the
            practical application of AI and ML techniques to tackle real-world
            environmental issues. The work conducted during this time
            exemplified the potential of technology to create sustainable
            solutions and address some of the most critical challenges our
            environment faces today. This experience has been instrumental in my
            professional growth and has instilled in me a strong commitment to
            leveraging technology for the betterment of our planet.
